  # Making *more* with *less*


  ## Plenitude is the EU-funded flagship project pioneering the mycoprotein value chain of the future


  By bringing together 10 partners from across Europe, we are creating ultra-sustainable foods and bio-based products using an innovative, minimal-waste fermentation process

  ## The Better Protein


  Mycoprotein is a *protein-rich* ingredient that comes from the Kingdom of Fungi—a hidden world of *microorganisms* with millions of species covering every surface of the planet. While some grow to form the fruiting bodies we know as mushrooms, others have different superpowers.


  *PLENITUDE* focuses on cultivating *Fusarium venenatum*, a species with impressive nutritional, flavor, and texture profiles that can easily be used in place of animal proteins to support more *sustainable* and *healthier* diets.

  ## Project  *Consortium*

   PLENITUDE partners leverage an innovative, circular bioprocess integrating the production of biofuel and mycoprotein. The result is ABUNDA, an ingredient used to produce high quality foods and bio-based products that set new standards for both sustainability and scalability.-

      ### Nutritious

      High-quality protein that is rich in fiber, low in saturated fat and salt, and contains no cholesterol. It is also a good source of vitamins and minerals, including iron, calcium, and vitamin B12.

      ### Sustainable

      Preliminary data show ABUNDA mycoprotein emits orders of magnitude lower levels of greenhouse gas emissions and uses significantly less land and water than is needed to produce animal proteins.

      ### Scalable

      Mycoprotein biomass doubles in hours and can be grown using inexpensive inputs and widely available infrastructure. At scale, one cow’s worth of protein can be produced in just minutes.
