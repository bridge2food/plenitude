    details: "  Mycoprotein has emerged as a promising ingredient for
      next-generation meat and dairy analogues—but challenges in formulation,
      processing, and functionality remain. This panel features experts from
      food tech, research, and industry who will unpack the technological
      hurdles and solutions in working with fungal proteins. Discussions will
      cover taste, texture, co-ingredients, and scalability. Panelists will also
      highlight collaborative opportunities between academia and business.
      Additionally, results from the Plenitude project will be shared, offering
      new insights into formulation strategies that improve mycoprotein
      performance across a range of applications."

        memberImage: /img/1.png
    details: "  After a brief overview of the Plenitude CBE JU project in which LCE
      takes part, the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study, focusing on mycoprotein
      and its environmental impacts, is presented. It aimed to identify key
      environmental hotspots within the production phase while also assessing
      the combined impacts of production, storage, and distribution. The study
      emphasized food-grade mycoprotein as an important protein source, enabling
      innovative recipes. Results showed that mycoprotein products performed
      comparably to plant-based proteins and better than animal-based proteins.
      Future assessments will further explore mycoprotein's environmental
      impact, emphasizing the role of LCA as an independent and “flexitarian”
      tool for all food alternatives."
  - title: Networking Lunch featuring a cooking demo with ABUNDA Mycoprotein
    startTime: 12:55 PM
    endTime: 1:55 PM

  - title: "Blending Cultivated Meat and Mycoprotein: Texture, Tech, and Innovation"
    startTime: 2:10 PM
    endTime: 2:20 PM
    details: Mosa Meat's will provide an overview of its technology and product
      development, followed by the preparation of blended systems with
      cultivated meat and mycoprotein. The data presented will be on the
      textural properties of these products, through rheological analysis of
      temperature ramps and prototype preparations in a shear cell. Blending
      these two components yields promising results, paving the way for
      innovative product development.

  - title: "GIANT LEAPS: An integrated perspective on the future of alternative
      proteins and the dietary shift towards healthy and sustainable diets"
    startTime: 2:25 PM
    endTime: 2:50 PM
    details: "Accelerating the protein transition is key to making our food system
      sustainable and healthier.​ This transition is complex: domains of
      availability, sustainability, safety, health, technical feasibility and
      consumer acceptance should all be addressed to understand the role of
      alternative proteins in future diets across Europe. GIANT LEAPS addresses
      these domains for alternative proteins including plant, single cell,
      insect and cultured meat protein sources. This presentation will provide
      an update on project progress, including defining scenarios for future
      European diets, and explore opportunities to leverage results and
      innovations from other projects, such as Plenitude, for maximal joint
      impact."

  - title: "Cellular Proteins as a Sustainable Source of Food Proteins "
    startTime: 3:25 PM
    endTime: 3:50 PM
    details: "In view of the protein transition, cellular proteins are one of the
      non-animal protein categories of interest. In the TKI Cellular Proteins
      project, we investigate factors influencing consumer interest throughout
      the cellular proteins production chain: from biomass generation on
      feedstocks, influence of fermentation parameters, processing, to
      functionality and product application tests. LCA analysis, regulatory
      status and consumer acceptance overarch the project. The combination of
      technical developments, consumer research and sustainability analyses
      deliver knowledge that industrial partners can use to build their strategy
      with respect to the application of cellular proteins as a tool within the
      protein transition."

      consumption.  This presentation will give insights on the mycoprotein
      functionality itself and in a food matrix, including techno-functionality
      and digestibility.  Mycoproteins are mainly stored frozen until use.
      Results on the impact of storage conditions on the functionality will be
      presented.
  - title: "Panel: How EU Institutions Foster Entrepreneurship in the Bio-based
      Sector"
    details: This panel brings together leaders from policy, academia, and industry
      to explore how EU institutions support innovation and entrepreneurship in
      the bio-economy. From funding mechanisms to cross-sector collaboration,
      panelists will share insights into building a competitive and sustainable
      bio-based economy. Discussions will highlight opportunities for startups,
      the role of education and talent development, and how upcoming policy
      shifts—such as the 2025 Danish EU Presidency—could shape future
      priorities. Join us for a forward-looking conversation on unlocking
      Europe's bio-innovation potential through strategic regulation, funding
      programs, and ecosystem-building.

    details: Protein transition remains a social, nutritional, and environmental
      priority; and as one of 16 Flagship projects under the CBE-JU, Plenitude
      demonstrates how increasing the circularity and sustainability of
      production systems meets the objectives of sustainability and the needs of
      consumers.  Large scale first-of-a-kind projects are both challenging and
      rewarding, and are enabled by politicians, grants, money, and companies
      but most fundamentally and essentially by people, with passion, tenacity
      and patience.   Plenitude’s path has never been linear.  It’s journey is
      only partially complete and its impact and legacy will build on a
      multitude of connections, learnings and collaborations.
  - title: "Presentation & Tasting: Low Food Lab: Researching Mycoprotein Beyond the
      Meat Analogue"
    details: "  In the Low Food Labs, we explore the potential of underutilized and
      undervalued ingredients through culinary experimentation and innovation.
      Collaborating with a select group of experts — including chefs, product
      developers, designers, and fermentation specialists — we conduct a wide
      range of experiments to unlock new possibilities in food. Our most recent
      lab, in partnership with ENOUGH and Cargill, focused on mycelium —
      specifically ABUNDA. We challenged our team to move beyond the meat
      analogue and explore a broader spectrum of applications. The result is a
      rich portfolio of concepts and recipes, now published and ready to
      inspire. In this session, we’ll share our lab philosophy and invite you to
      taste one of our creations"
