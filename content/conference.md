  #### Join the Plenitude Final Conference and discover groundbreaking
  innovations shaping new bio-based value chains and discuss how these can be
  actualized in the European landscape! Here, you will learn how these solutions
  provide environmental, economic, and public health benefits while addressing
  the world’s most pressing sustainability challenges.


  #### Since 2019, PLENITUDE—a CBE JU-funded project—has brought together 10 European partners from agri-food, biotechnology, academia, and beyond, with €16.9 million in funding from the Circular Bio-based Europe Joint Undertaking. This consortium has pioneered cutting-edge solutions to advance a sustainable future through a unique circular, minimal-waste process for mycoprotein production and its applications in food and beyond.


  #### As the project concludes, we’re thrilled to showcase the results of this transformative journey and host keynote speakers driving innovation and sustainability in the bio-based industry.
