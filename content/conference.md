  #### Since 2019, PLENITUDE—a CBE JU-funded project—has brought together 10 European partners from agri-food, biotechnology, academia, and beyond, with €16.9 million in funding from the Circular Bio-based Europe Joint Undertaking. This consortium has pioneered cutting-edge solutions to advance a sustainable future through a unique circular, minimal-waste process for mycoprotein production and its applications in food and beyond.


  #### As the project concludes, we’re thrilled to showcase the results of this transformative journey and host keynote speakers driving innovation and sustainability in the bio-based industry.
