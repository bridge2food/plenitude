      ## THE *PROJECT*


      PLENITUDE is a consortium of 10 partners from across Europe joined by a common goal: to build new bio-based value chains that address some of the worldâ€™s most urgent sustainability challenges. The key is ABUNDA mycoproteinâ€”a protein-rich ingredient from the Kingdom of Fungi with impressive nutritional and functional properties.
        
      Together, PLENITUDE partners are creating new ABUNDA-based products and researching their applications as sustainable and scalable alternatives to more resource-intensive livestock products.
        
      Launched in 2019, PLENITUDE has received â‚¬16.9 million in funding from the Circular Bio-based Europe Joint Undertaking [(CBE JU)](https://www.cbe.europa.eu/). Consortium partners include leaders in agri-food production and processing, biotechnology, product development, academia, life cycle assessment, and strategic communications.

      ## OUR *CHALLENGE*


      The production of livestock and animal feed is a leading cause of greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and biodiversity loss, occupying nearly 80% of the worldâ€™s agricultural land[ðŸ”—](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/). Current levels of production and consumption cannot be sustained without severe consequences for the planet and future generations[ðŸ”—](https://eatforum.org/eat-lancet-commission/). However, demand for animal protein is still projected to increase significantly as the global population grows.


      Policy interventions and behavioral change are necessary, but they can be slow and are often constrained by political and cultural barriers. A new approach is needed to support evidence-based policies and healthier dietary patterns.

  ## Target Impact

      ![targetIcon](/img/targetIcon1.svg)

      ### Novel Technology

      At the core of PLENITUDE is a novel way of producing protein. By integrating an aerobic fermentation plant with a conventional first-generation biorefinery, ABUNDA improves the sustainability of mycoprotein production through a circular, minimal-waste model where the main effluent stream undergoes a second fermentation to produce ethanol. 

      ABUNDA technology can be implemented anywhere in the world where there is demand for more sustainable protein and bio-based products.

      ### Protein Supply

      PLENITUDE partners are creating new applications for mycoprotein. By serving as appealing substitutes for animal-based products, these will increase the availability of sustainable and nutritious protein-rich foods and ingredients to meet rising consumer demands. 

      In doing so, PLENITUDE helps future-proof food security, while addressing sustainability and public health dilemmas associated with animal protein production.

      ### Value Chains


      The multisectoral nature of the PLENITUDE consortium enables development of full value chains for ABUNDA mycoprotein products. From raw agricultural inputs to processing, production, and packaging, PLENITUDE aims to build supply chains for at least two new consumer products. 


      Once established, these can grow independently, generating a wide range of economic benefits, including safeguarding and creating employment opportunities in both urban and rural areas.

      ![](/img/health.svg)


      ### Public Health


      PLENITUDE will increase access to food sources that are protein-rich, high in fibre, cholesterol-free, and which can easily serve as substitutes for animal-based products. By making such foods more available and affordable, PLENITUDE can help address the prevalence of common lifestyle diseases. 


      Cleaner, more efficient protein production will also help reduce pandemic risk[ðŸ”—](https://www.unep.org/resources/report/preventing-future-zoonotic-disease-outbreaks-protecting-environment-animals-and)[ðŸ”—](https://www.ipbes.net/pandemics) and antimicrobial resistance threats[ðŸ”—](https://www.who.int/news/item/07-11-2017-stop-using-antibiotics-in-healthy-animals-to-prevent-the-spread-of-antibiotic-resistance) coming from the production of livestock and animal products.

      ![](/img/sustainability.svg)


      ### Sustainability


      PLENITUDE will demonstrate a mycoprotein-biorefinery process capable of offsetting more than 11 million tonnes of CO2 and reducing water consumption by 13.8 billion cubic metres per year compared to beef farming. This will also reduce pressure on land, water resources, and biodiversity.  


      Preliminary research shows consumption of ABUNDA mycoprotein as a kg-per-kg replacement for meat (average consumption levels) equates to a reduction of more than 90% in both carbon emissions and land use.

      ### Evidence-Based Policy


      PLENITUDE results will be quantified by completing a full assessment of the environmental, economic, and social impacts of the projectâ€™s value chains. These findings will be used to improve project processes and outcomes, while supporting evidence-based policies and investments. 


      Evaluations will be made using life cycle assessment (LCA), life cycle costing (LCC), and social LCA (SLCA) methodologies based on the latest available standards.
