ABUNDA made its debut at the Plenitude Steering Committee Meeting in Turin, Italy on Wednesday, April 12, 2023. During this biannual gathering, hosted by LCE, the consortium members were served mycoprotein-based “chicken style” filets, produced using bioprocess technology developed to address modern challenges of global protein sustainability. The tasting marks a key milestone toward the ingredient’s upcoming launch in European markets.
