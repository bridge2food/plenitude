### **Inside the IFF / ENOUGH Collaboration in Plenitude: A New Era of Meat Analogs**

\-

In this interview, we speak with **Jos Muilwijk, Global Innovation Marketing Leader for Culinary & Snacks**, and **Marlene Lassen, Culinary Designer at IFF**, about their work on the Plenitude project. They discuss the innovative use of **ENOUGH's ABUNDA mycoprotein** in developing animal-free meat alternatives, the challenges faced, and the exciting future of sustainable food products.

**Q1: Can you share a bit about IFF’s role in the Plenitude project?**

Since the project began in 2019, IFF has been deeply involved in two key areas. First, we’ve focused on sensory and consumer science. We conducted market research across four major European countries, engaging over 80 consumers to explore the potential for alternative proteins, with a particular focus on mycoprotein. This gave us some fascinating insights into consumer preferences. We then worked with expert panels to compare the taste, texture, and aroma of ABUNDA mycoprotein to other plant-based proteins like soy and pea, and even real meat benchmarks like chicken. These findings were aligned with chemical flavor analysis done by Wageningen University & Research (WUR) to really understand what’s driving those taste differences.

The second area of focus has been product design. Since August 2023, we’ve been developing recipes using ABUNDA mycoprotein, specifically for the ambient food market. This has been an exciting challenge, and we’ve already showcased some of these recipes at exhibitions like BRF Europe.

**Q2: What kinds of products are you developing with ABUNDA, and why were these chosen?**

We’re working on a range of meat-free, ambient-stable products, including meat-free Spam, canned sausages, and smoked sausages. These product types were selected because they’re such staples on supermarket shelves in many European countries. There’s a big demand for plant-based versions of familiar foods, and ABUNDA gives us a fantastic opportunity to meet that need with something new and innovative.

**Q3: What challenges have you faced in developing these products, and how does Mycoprotein compare to other plant-based ingredients?**

ABUNDA Mycoprotein has a very different profile compared to typical plant-based proteins. Most plant-based proteins come in the form of dry powders, but ABUNDA is a fibrous matrix with a high moisture content—around 75%. This meant we couldn’t just apply our existing plant-based recipes directly; instead, we had to tweak and adapt them to make ABUNDA work.

There was a lot of trial and error in the beginning. For instance, ABUNDA can create a gummy, elastic texture in some applications, which we were able to manage by adjusting the pH. Its neutral taste, though, was a huge advantage—compared to other proteins, it doesn’t need as much masking, which allows the natural flavors to come through.

We also had to think about making these products ambient stable, meaning they could be stored at room temperature. This requires a final heating step in production, which can change the texture, color, and flavor. Instead of seeing that as a challenge, we turned it into a benefit. The heat treatment actually helped us enhance certain qualities in the final product.

**Q4: What makes this partnership through the Plenitude project so special for IFF?**

It’s been a really unique opportunity for us. Through the partnership, we’ve been able to dive deep into understanding mycoprotein, particularly ABUNDA, and how it fits into our broader ingredients portfolio. We’ve dedicated a lot of research time to fine-tuning ABUNDA as an ingredient, and not just on its own, but in combination with other in-house ingredients.

Another benefit has been the synergy that’s developed with our research partners. The collaboration goes beyond just the consortium—it’s opened up doors for future projects as well. Plus, being able to show our customers real, tangible innovation like this is a huge win for us.

**Q5: How was the recent meeting in Denmark, and what were the key takeaways?**

Denmark was a great moment for us to reflect on the progress we’ve made. We looked at the recipes we’ve developed using ABUNDA and compared them to what’s currently on the market. We tasted the products, talked about how IFF’s ingredients performed, and discussed why certain components needed to be included. There was also a lot of conversation around the best route to market for these prototypes.

It felt like a celebration of everything we’ve accomplished as a team so far, and we left feeling excited about the next steps.

**Q6: What’s next for IFF in terms of bringing ABUNDA-based products to the market?**

Now that we’ve gathered all these insights from our research and development efforts, we’re really in a good position to move forward with commercialization. The next step is identifying the right partners in the European market and refining our strategy to make sure these ABUNDA-based products hit the shelves successfully. It’s an exciting time, and we’re looking forward to seeing how consumers respond to these new plant-based alternatives.
