faq:
  - faqQustion: Is ABUNDA mycoprotein plant-based?
    faqAnswer: Technically speaking, no, since it is the result of the fermentation
      of the fungus, Fusarium Venanatum. Sometimes in the common language,
      mycoprotein is included under the plant-based umbrella, but it would be
      more correct to call it an "alternative protein".
  - faqQustion: Is Plenitude a company?
    faqAnswer: >
      No, Plenitude is a consortium of 10 partners operating under the funding
      program Horizon 2020. Plenitude is funded by the European Commission and
      the Bio-Based Industries Joint Undertaking and lasts 6 years (2019-2025).
  - faqQustion: Where is Plenitude based?
    faqAnswer: Plenitude's partners are spread across Europe (e.g., The Netherlands,
      France, Italy, and the United Kingdom). The ENOUGH plant where ABUNDA is
      produced is located in Sas Van Gent, The Netherlands, co-located with a
      Cargill bio-refinery.
  - faqQustion: What does "integrated bio-process" mean?
    faqAnswer: Plenitude's core is the integrated bio-process bringing together
      bio-ethanol and mycoprotein production. The two distinct processes are
      integrated meaning that they share the input, a grain-based feedstock, and
      are co-located, to reduce potential issues related to transportation. In
      fact, the Cargill bio-refinery and the ENOUGH mycoprotein plant are just a
      few hundred meters from each other. This makes both bio-processes more
      sustainable.
  - faqQustion: What does ABUNDA mycoprotein taste of?
    faqAnswer: ABUNDA has a rather neutral taste, allowing a diverse range of food
      applications.
