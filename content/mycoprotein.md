  # what is *Mycoprotein*

  Mycoprotein is a sustainable protein source derived from fungi. It boasts an impressive nutritional profile and unique structural characteristics, making it a versatile ingredient with wide-ranging applications.    


  Since the 1960s, mycoprotein has been studied as a promising way to improve food security and address the sustainability dilemmas of modern livestock production.   


  While several species of fungi are currently used to produce mycoprotein for food applications, PLENITUDE is developing new products and building value chains for ABUNDA—a mycoprotein ingredient grown from the species Fusarium venenatum.

  ## How is it *Made?*


  Fungi have lived on Earth for over one billion years. Today, there are millions of species covering every surface of the planet, though most are microscopic and remain invisible to the naked eye.    
    
  Mycoprotein production uses filamentous fungi to grow mycelium, a root-like matrix of fibres that only takes hours to double in mass.

      ### Select the strain

      Fungal species and strains are carefully selected for key attributes, including rate of growth, ability to convert raw plant materials, nutritional profile, flavor, texture, and food safety.

      ### Cultivation

      Once the strain has been selected, it is cultivated in a bioreactor or fermentation tank—a stainless steel vessel that provides optimal conditions for the fungus to thrive, including temperature, pH levels, and oxygen supply.  
        

        
      The cultivation process also involves providing a steady supply of plant material as a source of nutrients to fuel rapid multiplication of the fungus’s mass.

      ### Harvest and treatment

      Once the desired biomass has grown, it is harvested from the fermentation tank and separated from the rest of the growth medium.   

      The raw mycoprotein is then subjected to heat treatment to ensure product stability and food safety by removing any unwanted enzymes or pathogens.

      ### Processing

      Mycoprotein can now be processed into consumer products by adding ingredients for flavor and aroma, texture, and culinary performance. 

      Other technologies can also be applied to make protein-derived nonfood products such as bioplastics.

  ## Nutritional *Advantages*

  Mycoprotein is a nutritional powerhouse. It boasts a complete protein profile, is low in saturated fat, and contains no cholesterol. Mycoprotein is also rich in fibre and is a source of vitamins and minerals, including iron, calcium, and vitamin B12. 

  When consumed in place of animal-based foods, mycoprotein could help improve nutritional imbalances associated with modern dietary patterns, supporting digestion, regulating blood sugar, and aiding in weight management. 

  Mycoprotein has also been found to support muscle growth better than dairy, the most common source of protein in the fitness supplement industry.

      ### Land use and deforestation

      The production of livestock and feed crops occupies nearly 80% of the world’s agricultural land and is the primary driver of global deforestation. 

      Mycoprotein production is estimated to use as much as 90% less land than animal-based meat production.

      ### Carbon footprint

      Preliminary research shows consumption of mycoprotein as a kg-per-kg replacement for meat (at average consumption levels) equates to a reduction of more than 90% in carbon emissions. 

      PLENITUDE helps bring these gains within reach by developing value chains that can scale to meet global demands.

      ### Water use and pollution

      Livestock farming uses a significant amount of fresh water, while its inputs and waste streams are leading causes of water pollution, harming ecosystems and posing serious public health risks. 

      Mycoprotein uses approximately 13.8 billion fewer cubic metres of water than beef farming, with far fewer agricultural inputs and minimal waste streams. any unwanted enzymes or pathogens.

      ### Biodiversity

      The combined impact of deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, and pollution from the livestock and feed industries is the primary driver of biodiversity loss. 

      By developing cost- and quality-competitive substitutes for livestock products, PLENITUDE offers a way of producing protein that is better for the planet and all its inhabitants.

  ## Scalability *Advantages*

  Animal-based food production cannot scale to meet current or growing global demands without serious consequences. Other emerging protein technologies show promise but still face significant technical barriers, regulatory hurdles, and consumer acceptance challenges. 

  Mycoprotein has a feed-conversion ratio superior to comparable animal- and plant-based products. ABUNDA mycoprotein, in particular, is produced in conjunction with bioethanol using well-established and widely available infrastructure, along with low-cost grains as its primary feedstock. 

  Using this technology, mycoprotein can be produced cleanly and efficiently at scale anywhere there is demand for high-quality protein-rich foods and bio-based products.

  ## Product *Applications*

  Mycoprotein unleashes culinary creativity with applications ranging from burgers, sausages, and nuggets, to protein-rich snacks and ingredients. It can also be used to enhance the nutrition, flavor, and texture profiles of dairy alternatives, as well as replace animal proteins in pet food. 

  Additionally, mycoprotein extends its versatility beyond the kitchen, as it can even be utilised to develop sustainable bioplastics.
